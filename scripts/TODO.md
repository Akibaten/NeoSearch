# __To do__
+ work on parallelization and multiple crawlers
+ + deque and async is most optimal maybe
+ rewrite and stop using recursion for crawling its bad
+ optimize insertion in keyword index database

 the search time is way too slow. for ~600 sites
  I'm using upwards of 11 seconds of cpu time for ONE WORD
  I need to switch to word id | site id instead of word string | site id
+ i need to switch to postgresql ELSIFHSOEUBHF:OSUEBHGF:OSEHGo


# __Done__
+ holy freak I deleted the new script for search with multiple keyword
  i wasn't that far into it but still grrrr
+ add multi keyword search
